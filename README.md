Start with Race1.py file.
Have students use the 4 commands to complete the race without crashing.
Explain sequence as it applies to programming.
Potential discussion questions.
1. Why did the order of the commands matter when programming the turtle?
2. Why couldn't you write all of the commands the first time and complete the race?
3. Explain how you used a program and then test it approach to complete the race.
4. How would you complete two laps using the code?
5. Is there an easier way to complete two laps without rewriting all of the commands?

Extension:  Students can use Race2.py to start incorporating loops when going around corners.
Perhaps use functions to make a turn left corner, turn right corner, straight away procedure.

Use Race4.py to start adding keyboard functionality.  Explain event handlers.  Use Race4withKeys.py as a final version of this.
potential discussion questions.
1. What are event handlers and how is it used in this program?
2. Why doesn't the program ever stop like Race1 did?
3. Describe in detail how you would program a keyboard button that does a donut on the track?
4. What would make the current game more fun?

Use Race4withKeys to start adding a second player.  Talk about the need to use objects to define two turtles and how properties are used to change aspects of the turtle.
Use Race4with2players.py as a final version of this.
Potential Discussion questions.
1. What are objects?
2. Why do you need to write player1.right(5) instead of right(5)?
3. How would you program a button to change the color of player1 turtle?
4. What are the current limitations of the game?
5. Describe how you would enhance this game to make it more fun.
